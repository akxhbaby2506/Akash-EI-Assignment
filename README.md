# Excersice-1: Morse Rover Stimulation

This project is a simulation of a rover navigating a grid with obstacles, following a set of commands. The rover can move in four directions (North, East, South, West) and turn left or right. The grid is defined with a specified width and height, and obstacles can be placed at specific coordinates.

# Excersice-2: Design Patterns in Java

## A. Structural Patterns

### 1. Adapter Pattern
Adapts a Bird to a ToyDuck interface using an Adapter.

### 2. Facade Pattern
Simplifies interactions with a zoo using a ZooFacade.

### 3. Proxy Pattern
Controls access to a RealLion using a ProxyLion.

## B. Creational Patterns

### 1. Singleton Pattern
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### 2. Factory Pattern
Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### 3. Builder Pattern
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## C. Behavioural Patterns

### 1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Allows an object to send a command without knowing what object will receive and handle it. Handles requests for different types of animals.

### 2. Memento Pattern
Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state. Saves and restores the state of an Animal.

### 3. Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
